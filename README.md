# Intro
Brew tap for [cppship](https://github.com/qqiangwu/cppship), a cargo-like cpp build tool.

I'm trying to contribute cppship to homebrew-core, but it **requires some stars**, [helps are welcomed](https://github.com/qqiangwu/cppship).

## Installation without tap
```bash
$ brew install qqiangwu/tap/cppship
```

## Installation using tap
```bash
$ brew tap qqiangwu/tap
$ brew install cppship
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
